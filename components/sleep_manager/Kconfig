    config SLEEP_MANAGER_ENABLE
        bool "Enable Sleep Manager"
        default n
        help
            Enable automatic sleep on inactivity.
            When enabled, the device will enter sleep mode after a period of inactivity.

    config SLEEP_MANAGER_BACKLIGHT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
        int "Backlight timeout (seconds)"
        depends on SLEEP_MANAGER_ENABLE
        default 10
        range 1 300
        help
            Time in seconds before turning off backlight due to inactivity.
            Backlight will turn off independently of sleep mode.

    config SLEEP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
        int "Sleep timeout (seconds)"
        depends on SLEEP_MANAGER_ENABLE
        default 30
        range 5 300
        help
            Time in seconds before entering sleep mode due to inactivity.
            Should typically be longer than backlight timeout.

    config SLEEP_MANAGER_BACKLIGHT_CONTROL
        bool "Control display backlight"
        depends on SLEEP_MANAGER_ENABLE
        default y
        help
            Turn off display backlight during sleep.
            Disable for testing sleep without affecting display.

    config SLEEP_MANAGER_LVGL_TIMER_PAUSE
        bool "Pause LVGL timers during sleep"
        depends on SLEEP_MANAGER_ENABLE
        default y
        help
            Automatically pause all LVGL timers when entering sleep.
            Disable to keep watchface updating in background during sleep.

    config SLEEP_MANAGER_LVGL_RENDERING_CONTROL
        bool "Disable LVGL rendering during sleep"
        depends on SLEEP_MANAGER_ENABLE
        default y
        help
            Stop LVGL from rendering frames during sleep.
            Disable to allow LVGL to continue rendering (uses more power).

    config SLEEP_MANAGER_GPIO_WAKEUP
        bool "Enable GPIO wake-up"
        depends on SLEEP_MANAGER_ENABLE
        default y
        help
            Enable hardware wake-up sources (boot button).
            Disable to test sleep without wake-up capability.

    config SLEEP_MANAGER_TOUCH_WAKEUP
        bool "Enable touch screen wake-up"
        depends on SLEEP_MANAGER_GPIO_WAKEUP
        default y
        help
            Enable touch screen as wake-up source.
            Disable to save battery and require boot button press to wake.
            When disabled, only the boot button (GPIO9) will wake the watch.

    config SLEEP_MANAGER_TOUCH_RESET_TIMER
        bool "Reset timer on touch events"
        depends on SLEEP_MANAGER_ENABLE
        default y
        help
            Reset inactivity timer when user touches the screen.
            Disable to test automatic sleep regardless of touch activity.

    config SLEEP_MANAGER_PREVENT_SLEEP_ON_USB
        bool "Prevent sleep when USB/JTAG connected"
        depends on SLEEP_MANAGER_ENABLE
        default y
        help
            Prevent automatic sleep when USB power (VBUS) is detected.
            Useful during development to keep screen on while debugging.
            Uses AXP2101 PMU VBUS detection.

    config SLEEP_MANAGER_PREVENT_SCREEN_OFF_ON_USB
        bool "Prevent screen off when USB/JTAG connected"
        depends on SLEEP_MANAGER_ENABLE
        default n
        help
            Prevent turning off screen backlight when USB power (VBUS) is detected.
            Useful during development to keep display visible while debugging.
            Independent of sleep prevention - screen stays on even if device enters light sleep.
            Uses AXP2101 PMU VBUS detection.

    config SLEEP_MANAGER_DEBUG_LOGS
        bool "Enable debug logging"
        depends on SLEEP_MANAGER_ENABLE
        default n
        help
            Enable detailed debug logs for sleep manager operations.
            Useful for troubleshooting but increases log verbosity.
